# C++ Data Types

## Variables and Data Types

C++ provides various data types to store different kinds of values. Here are a few commonly used data types:

* **int:** Used for whole numbers (e.g., 1, 42, -10).
* **float and double:** Used for floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.718).
* **char:** Used for individual characters (e.g., 'A', 'b', '!').
* **bool:** Used for boolean values (true or false).

To declare a variable, specify its type followed by its name. For example:


int age = 25;
float pi = 3.14;
char grade = 'A';
bool isStudent = true;


## Data Type Sizes

The size of a data type in C++ is determined by the compiler. The following table shows the approximate sizes of the commonly used data types:

| Data Type | Size |
|---|---|
| int | 4 bytes |
| float | 4 bytes |
| double | 8 bytes |
| char | 1 byte |
| bool | 1 byte |

## Data Type Ranges

The range of values that can be stored in a data type is also determined by the compiler. The following table shows the approximate ranges of the commonly used data types:

| Data Type | Range |
|---|---|
| int | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| float | 3.402823466E+38 to 1.17549435E-38 |
| double | 1.7976931348623157E+308 to 2.2250738585072014E-308 |
| char | 0 to 255 |
| bool | true or false |

## Data Type Modifiers

C++ provides a number of data type modifiers that can be used to change the size or range of a data type. The following table shows some of the commonly used data type modifiers:

| Data Type Modifier | Description |
|---|---|
| short | Reduces the size of the data type by half. |
| long | Increases the size of the data type by half. |
| signed | Indicates that the data type can store both positive and negative values. |
| unsigned | Indicates that the data type can only store positive values. |

## Exercises

1. Declare a variable of type `int` and initialize it to the value 10.
2. Declare a variable of type `float` and initialize it to the value 3.14.
3. Declare a variable of type `char` and initialize it to the character 'A'.
4. Declare a variable of type `bool` and initialize it to the value true.
5. Print the values of the variables you declared in exercises 1-4.
